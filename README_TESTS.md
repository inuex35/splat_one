# SPLAT_ONE Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about the testing system implemented for SPLAT_ONE. The test suite is designed to ensure code reliability, maintainability, and proper functionality across the application.

## Changes in Code Structure

The original codebase has been refactored to improve modularity and testability:

1. **Module Separation**:
   - Core functionality has been separated into domain-specific modules
   - UI components are now organized into a logical hierarchy
   - Business logic has been moved from UI classes where possible

2. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Added abstraction through base classes and inheritance
   - Improved encapsulation by moving related functionality into specific classes
   - Reduced code duplication through shared behaviors

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Added comprehensive test suite using pytest
   - Created fixtures and test helpers for common testing scenarios
   - Implemented mocking for external dependencies

## Testing Structure

The tests are organized as follows:

- `tests/conftest.py`: Common fixtures and test utilities
- `tests/test_*.py`: Individual test modules for each application component
- `tests/README.md`: Documentation for the test system

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, make sure you have pytest and the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock
```

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

For a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

To run specific tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_camera_models.py
```

## Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions and classes in isolation
   - Mock dependencies to focus on the unit under test
   - Fast execution for quick feedback

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify proper communication between modules
   - Ensure system works as a whole

## Mocking Strategy

To avoid dependencies on GUI components and external libraries during testing, we use a combination of:

- `unittest.mock` for Python standard library mocking
- `pytest-mock` for pytest-style fixtures
- Custom mock objects for complex dependencies

## Future Testing Improvements

1. Add more tests for other tabs and components as they are refactored
2. Implement UI testing for checking GUI interactions
3. Add performance tests for critical operations
4. Implement continuous integration for automatic test runs
